Markup provided by @gitlab user University-of-Minnesota-Boot-Camp. Additional HTML behavior markup further edited to fit javascript command goals. 

## User Interface

Follow instructions as displayed on page linked from project turn in source and current github repository. To reset initialization, reload page is required. Further interface prior to generation will reshuffle the result from deployment of the javascript. This behavior as mentioned was discovered as a byproduct when the javascript completed it's intended prompt. 

## From the contributor

Window objects 'confirm', 'alert', and 'prompt' was discarded from the original javascript markup due to verbose feedback when debugging with the console. Made with love <3.
